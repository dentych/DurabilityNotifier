DurabilityNotifier
==================

This is a plugin that will warn the user when the durability of his tool drops below 10.
When the user is warned about the durability of his tool, he can stop using it in time for it to be repaired, which is especially useful if it's a good enchanted tool.

--------
* Warns about almost broken tools
  * Checks when tool is being used
  * Or if tool is used to hit a mob/player
* Warns about armour almost broken (PLANNED FEATURE)
* Commands for checking the durability of tools/armour (PLANNED FEATURE)
